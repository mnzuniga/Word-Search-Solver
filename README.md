# Word Search Solver

This project is part of CSE-031: Computer Organization and Assembly Language course.

**Language:** C

The main program (`wordsearch.c`) reads a puzzle grid from a text file, where the first number indicates the size of the grid. It then prompts the user for a word to search and searches for it in the puzzle grid. The search is case insensitive, and all directions are allowed.

## Usage

To use this program:
1. Compile `wordsearch.c`.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Follow the prompts to input the puzzle grid file and the word to search.
